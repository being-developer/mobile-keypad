# Mobile-keypad : Old Mobile phone`s keypad simulator


If you quickly press a particular key. The letter is printed on the
white space above and cycles through all the letters on that key. If you press after some time(I set delay to `2 seconds`). It should append to the previously typed character and start to cycle through letters on that key.
This project is a simulator of old mobile phone`s keypad wriiten in AngularJS with es6 syntax.
